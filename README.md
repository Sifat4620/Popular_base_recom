# Popular recommendation systems
Popular recommendation systems are algorithms and techniques used to suggest items to users based on their popularity or the preferences of the broader user community. These systems do not consider the specific tastes or preferences of individual users but instead recommend items that are generally popular or frequently accessed by a large number of users. Popular recommendation systems are often used in scenarios where personalized data about users is limited or where a simple and easy-to-implement solution is needed. Here are some popular approaches to building recommendation systems based on popularity:

1. **Most Popular Items (MP):** This is the simplest form of a popularity-based recommendation system. It recommends items that are accessed or rated the most by users. For example, a news website might recommend the most-read articles to new visitors.

2. **Trending Items:** This approach recommends items that have seen a recent surge in popularity. It's often used in scenarios where freshness or trending topics are important, such as social media platforms or e-commerce websites.

3. **Top-Rated Items:** Instead of considering the sheer number of interactions, this approach recommends items with the highest average ratings or user reviews. It assumes that items with higher ratings are more likely to be appreciated by users.

4. **Hot Items:** Hot items are those that are currently receiving a high level of user engagement, such as a high number of views, likes, or shares. This approach is common in content platforms like YouTube or Reddit.

5. **Bestsellers:** In e-commerce, this approach recommends items that are selling well, assuming that popular items are likely to meet the needs of most users.

6. **User-Generated Lists:** Some recommendation systems allow users to create and share lists of their favorite items. These lists can be used to recommend popular items based on the lists that have received the most attention or followers.

7. **Editor's Picks:** In some cases, editors or curators may manually select and recommend items that they believe will be of interest to users. This approach is often used in content curation services like music streaming platforms.

8. **Collaborative Filtering with Popularity:** While collaborative filtering is typically a personalized recommendation method, it can be combined with popularity-based recommendations to provide a balance. For example, recommending popular items that are also relevant to a user's past behavior.

Popular recommendation systems are straightforward to implement and can be effective in situations where personalization is less critical or for new users with limited interaction history. However, they may not provide the best user experience in cases where users have diverse interests and preferences, as they do not take individual user behavior into account. Hybrid approaches that combine popularity-based recommendations with more advanced techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering are often used to strike a balance between personalization and popularity.
